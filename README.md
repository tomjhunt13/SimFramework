# SimFramework

## Overview
SimFramework is a standalone C++ block diagram simulation framework created for my final year masters engineering project: "Eco Academy: An educational video game". The framework was used to create a simulation of an internal combustion engine powered vehicle. This was wrapped into a plugin for the Unreal Engine 4 game engine (plugin repository: https://github.com/tomjhunt13/SimInterface). This was used to communicate between the simulation and the game (game repository: https://github.com/tomjhunt13/EcoAcademy).

Included in this repository is the framework and the vehicle model. Additionally, my dissertation is included for detailed reference.
